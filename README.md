# Covid19-Simulation-and-Visualization

In this course project, the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model was used to simulate and visualize the COVID-19 pandemic data for four countries: Germany, Italy, South Korea, and the UK. The SIR model is a mathematical model that tracks the spread of infectious diseases within a population and helps to understand the impact of various interventions such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and vaccination.

The project used real-world data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, recovered cases, and deaths in the four countries to calibrate the SIR model. The project then visualized the results of the SIR model simulation, showing how the spread of COVID-19 could be affected by different intervention strategies.

The project aimed to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of interventions, as well as to demonstrate the usefulness of mathematical models in understanding and managing infectious diseases. The project code and results can be found in the GitHub repository.
